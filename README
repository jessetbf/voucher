If you want all exported data from the beginning I can get it from my Backblaze account.

The export from last September 15th contains columns that I removed from the database because they weren’t being used.

There are some tables in the database that have nothing to do with the voucher app.

If you want to use the Vibralogix Sitelok login manager, I can send that along separately.

I didn’t send the front-end menu app because it was created with Rapidweaver. If you still want it, let me know.
